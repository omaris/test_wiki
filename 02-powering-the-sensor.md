You can use the provided USB 3.0 micro-b cable to power your sensor. Your USB controller on your computer should be able to provide at least 500 mA. If your USB port provides less than 500 mA, the sensor might still start up, but the image stream will be flickering in this case.

Otherwise, you can connect your sensor to a 12 V power supply using the Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connector and contacts supplied with the sensor. Please refer to the figure below for polarity information. The input voltage can vary from 10-15V, so connecting the sensor directly to a battery is feasible.
